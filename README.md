# Prodex

A tool for querying and building the perfect PokÃ©mon team.

You can access the app here:  
https://phcs93.github.io/prodex/

It features a wide variety of filters and charts to help you find the best match for your team.

This project is a new version of an older project I've made:

# TO-DO

- figure a way to use separate .html files (web loader?)

## filters

- evolution filters (render evolutions when filtering)
  - number of evolutions (depth)
  - number of branches
  - evolution method (items, trading, etc)
    - if item, choose which item to filter by

## database

- determine if pokemon is obtainable in version 
  - by evolution -> DONE
  - by hatching egg  -> DONE
  - by trading from sister version
    - detect if pokemon can be traded from other generations

## moves window

- show pre-evolution moves
- highlight STAB (also highlight damage type based on highest pokemon stat)

## important things

- consider abilities when calculating pokemon weakness (attacking and defending)
- consider generation when filtering move type (some normal moves became fairy)
- determine move damage type by generation
- encounters for regional forms should be the same as their base form (?)
- change "only obtainable" flag to "show from all versions" (remember to unconsider version on moves, held items, etc)
  - actually it would be simpler to just disable all version dependant filters

## add filters

- evolution
  - by item
  - by method
  - by number of evolutions

## team builder 

- select pokemon moves
- also select ability, nature, level, EVs, IVs
- select gender
- select shiny
- hear cry
- show location with both list and map image (like in the game)
- show sprite based on selected generation
  - one spritesheet per generation?
  - one gif collection per generation?

## charts

- calculate team types vulnerabilites and advantages
- number of pokemons team has advantage on by type
- number of pokemons per type
- type effectiveness table
- natures & tastes
