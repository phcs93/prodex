# Prodex

A tool for querying and building the perfect PokÃ©mon team.

You can access the app here:  
https://phcs93.github.io/prodex/

It features a wide variety of filters and charts to help you find the best match for your team.

This project is a new version of an older project I've made:

# TO-DO

- figure a way to use separate .html files (web loader?)
- I could really improve the UX/UI in general but I don't have time for this anymore

## pokemon details

- show icon for
  - shape
  - footprint
  - color

## filters

- evolution filters (render evolutions when filtering)
  - number of evolutions (depth)
  - number of branches
  - evolution method (items, trading, etc)
    - if item, choose which item to filter by

## database

- determine if pokemon is obtainable in version 
  - by evolution -> DONE
  - by hatching egg -> DONE
  - by trading from sister version
    - detect if pokemon can be traded from other generations

## important things

- consider abilities when calculating pokemon weakness (attacking and defending)
- consider generation when filtering move type (some normal moves became fairy)
- encounters for regional forms should be the same as their base form (?)
- change "only obtainable" flag to "show from all versions" (remember to unconsider version on moves, held items, etc)
  - actually it would be simpler to just disable all version dependant filters

## charts

- calculate team types vulnerabilites and advantages
- number of pokemons team has advantage on by type
- number of pokemons per type
- type effectiveness table
- natures & tastes

## missing cries

- from 722 onwards

## missing footprints

- I think newer generations don't use footprints anymore

## crazy ideias

- change style based on selected game version
  - css (match in-game menus and font)
  - pokemon sprites
  - pokemon cries
  - menu sounds
  - background

- show the map of the region corresponding to the selected version when visualizing pokemon encounter details
  - just like this guy did here: https://simplyblgdev.github.io/Pokemon/Kanto
